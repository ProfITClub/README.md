## Who are we?
Our organization is developing a web service where everyone can learn something new about the IT world and take interesting tests to find out their level of knowledge, and a mobile application that repeats the rules of the ProfIT board game.

**Information technology to the masses**

Our task is to attract more schoolchildren, students and adults to the field of information technology in the Russian Federation and beyond.
It is very important for us that learning is exciting and interesting.
